Description:
This dashboard presents five interactive graphs:
1. Gender Distribution – a pie chart showing the proportion of male and female patients.
2. Age Distribution – a chart showing patient ages (pink for women, blue for men).
3. Lifestyle – a bar chart representing patients’ lifestyle habits and their percentages. For example, the light-green portion of the right bar (87.96%) shows people who neither smoke nor drink and are physically active.
4. Height Distribution – shows the distribution of patient heights, also compared with alcohol consumption.
5. Weight Distribution – shows the distribution of patient weights, also compared with smoking status.
On the left side of the dashboard, there is a Gender Selector for filtering the data.
