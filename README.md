### Dashboard Overview

This interactive Tableau dashboard provides insights into patient demographics and lifestyle factors associated with cardiovascular disease. It consists of five main visualizations:
1.	Gender Distribution – Pie chart showing the proportion of male and female patients.
2.	Age Distribution – Age breakdown by gender (pink for women, blue for men).
3.	Lifestyle Analysis – Bar chart illustrating patients’ lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity).
-	Example: 87.96% of patients neither smoke nor drink and are physically active.
4.	Height Distribution – Distribution of patient heights with comparison to alcohol consumption.
5.	Weight Distribution – Distribution of patient weights with comparison to smoking status.

Additionally, a Gender Selector on the left side of the dashboard enables quick filtering and targeted analysis.

### Key Insight

The dashboard highlights demographic and behavioral factors that may influence cardiovascular health, helping to identify trends and support preventive measures.
